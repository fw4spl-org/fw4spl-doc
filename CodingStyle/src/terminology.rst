Terminology
===========

- Rules are mandatory. Any rule can be (exceptionally) exceeded, but if so, it has to be rigorously justified.
- Recommendations are optional.
- **Camel case** is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter. In programming languages, **camel case** is assumed to start with a lowercase letter. We will use the term **upper camel case** when it starts with a capital.
